        <h1>How We Pick Drivers</h1>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Every race weekend, our family F1 fantasy league asks each player to pick 5 drivers
          before qualifying. The scoring is simple: points for finishing in the top 10
          (25 for a win, down to 1 for P10), and a brutal -20 penalty for a DNF. No qualifying
          bonuses, no overtake points, no fastest lap. Just where you finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the question is straightforward: which 5 drivers will score the most points this
          weekend? Gut feel gets you part of the way. Everyone knows the Mercedes and Ferrari
          drivers are strong this year. But how do you decide between a consistent midfield
          driver and a volatile frontrunner? Is a driver with a 15% chance of winning but an
          8% chance of DNF a better pick than someone who will reliably finish P6-P8?
        </p>
        <p>
          You need expected points — and to get those, you need probability distributions over
          finishing positions. That's where betting markets come in.
        </p>

        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Betting markets are remarkably good at aggregating information. Thousands of bettors,
          each with their own models, insider knowledge, and informed opinions, collectively
          set odds that reflect the true probabilities of race outcomes more accurately than
          any individual prediction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can extract those probabilities — but it takes a few steps. Bookmaker odds aren't
          raw probabilities; they include a margin (the "vig") that guarantees the house a profit.
          And even after removing the vig, the odds only give us marginal probabilities for specific
          outcomes (who wins, who finishes top 3), not the full joint distribution we need to
          compute expected fantasy points.
        </p>

        <h2>The Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          Here's how we go from raw betting odds to expected fantasy points:

          The inputs are whatever betting markets are available: race winner odds (almost always),
          plus podium, top 6, top 10, and DNF markets when we can find them. More markets mean
          tighter constraints on the model. The output is a full probability distribution over
          all 23 outcomes (P1 through P22, plus DNF) for every driver — and from that, expected
          fantasy points in our scoring system.
        </p>

        <h2>Scoring Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Each player picks 5 drivers before qualifying each weekend (same drivers for sprint + race).
          No budget cap, no qualifying points, no fastest lap. Just finishing position.
        </p>
        <ScoringTable scoring={scoringWithSprint} />
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12 }}>
          Sprint weekends (China, Miami, Canada, Great Britain, Netherlands, Singapore) add sprint
          race points on top of the Grand Prix points. A DNF in either race costs -20.

        <h2>Convert Odds to Fair Probabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Bookmaker odds embed a margin (the "vig"). A +200 line doesn't mean 33% — it means
          something less, once you account for the bookmaker's edge. We use <strong>Shin's method</strong> to
          remove the vig. Unlike simple normalization, Shin's method corrects for the
          favorite-longshot bias: bookmakers systematically underprice favorites and overprice
          longshots. The method solves for an "insider trading" parameter z, then backs out
          fair probabilities. The result: probabilities that sum to exactly 1.0, with the bias removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pull odds from The Odds API (race winner market) and supplement with manual odds
          from Oddschecker for podium, top 6, top 10, and DNF markets when available. More
          markets = tighter constraints on the model.
        </p>

        <details className="deep-dive">
          <summary>Deep dive: Why Shin's method?</summary>
          <div className="deep-dive-content">
            <h4>What is the vig?</h4>
            <p>
              Suppose a bookmaker offers odds on a two-horse race. Horse A is -150
              (implied probability 60%) and Horse B is +120 (implied probability 45.5%).
              Those probabilities sum to 105.5%, not 100%. The extra 5.5% is the bookmaker's
              margin — the vig. They pay out less than the true odds would require, guaranteeing
              a profit regardless of the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              For F1, the vig is typically 15-30% across 22 drivers. To get fair probabilities,
              we need to remove it — but how we remove it matters a lot.
            </p>

            <h4>Approach 1: Multiplicative normalization</h4>
            <p>
              The simplest approach: divide each implied probability by the sum of all implied
              probabilities. If the implied probs sum to 1.20, just divide everything by 1.20.
              This is mathematically clean but assumes the vig is distributed proportionally
              across all outcomes. In reality, it isn't.
            </p>

            <h4>Approach 2: Power method</h4>
            <p>
              Find an exponent k such that the implied probabilities raised to the power k
              sum to 1.0. This allows the vig to be distributed non-uniformly — higher-probability
              outcomes get more of the adjustment. Better than multiplicative, but the functional
              form is arbitrary.
            </p>

            <h4>Approach 3: Shin's method (what we use)</h4>
            <p>
              In 1991 and 1992, Hyun Song Shin published a model of betting markets that treats
              the overround as a consequence of insider trading. The key insight: bookmakers
              set odds knowing that some fraction z of bettors have inside information. To protect
              themselves against these informed bettors, bookmakers shade the odds — but they shade
              favorites less and longshots more, because an insider bet on a longshot is more
              costly to the bookmaker than an insider bet on a favorite.
            </p>
            <p>
              This produces exactly the favorite-longshot bias observed in real betting markets:
              favorites tend to have odds that are closer to fair, while longshots have odds that
              are more inflated. Shin's method solves for the insider fraction z via bisection,
              then uses it to back out fair probabilities. The result naturally corrects for the
              bias without any arbitrary assumptions about the functional form.
            </p>
            <p>
              For F1, where the favorite might have 15% true win probability and the backmarker
              might have 0.1%, this distinction matters. Multiplicative normalization would
              underestimate the favorite's true probability and overestimate the longshot's.
              Shin's method gives more accurate results, especially in the tails.

      {/* ====== STEP 2: PLACKETT-LUCE ====== */}
      <section className="meth-section">
        <div className="step-num">2</div>
        <h2>Fit the Plackett-Luce Model</h2>
        <p>
          The Plackett-Luce model assigns each driver a strength parameter <strong>{'\u03BB'}</strong> (lambda).
          The probability that driver i wins from a remaining set S is simply {'\u03BB'}_i / {'\u03A3\u03BB'}_j.
          A full finishing order is generated by drawing winners sequentially: pick the winner
          from all drivers, then pick 2nd from the remaining set, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decompose strength as <code>log({'\u03BB'}) = {'\u03BC'}_team + {'\u03B4'}_driver</code>, so teammates share
          a team component. This creates natural positive correlation — if one Mercedes is strong,
          both are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tricky part is fitting. Given a candidate set of {'\u03BB'} values, there's no closed-form way
          to compute "what does the model predict for P(Russell finishes top 3)?" — you have to
          simulate it. So the optimizer works like this:
        </p>
        <ol style={{ color: 'var(--text-muted)', fontSize: '0.85rem', lineHeight: 1.7, marginLeft: 18, marginBottom: 10, maxWidth: 640 }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Start with an initial guess for all 22 {'\u03BB'} values (based on the win probabilities).</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Simulate ~20,000 races using those {'\u03BB'} values. From the simulated results, compute model-implied
            cumulative probabilities: P(top 1), P(top 3), P(top 6), P(top 10) for each driver.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Compare those model probabilities to the devigged market probabilities. The loss function is the
            sum of squared errors across all drivers and markets, plus regularization terms that penalize
            large gaps between teammates and extreme {'\u03BB'} values.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>The optimizer (scipy's <strong>L-BFGS-B</strong> — a quasi-Newton method) uses the loss and its
            approximate gradient to choose a direction in 22-dimensional parameter space and take a step.
            L-BFGS-B approximates the Hessian from recent gradient evaluations, so it can take
            informed steps without computing second derivatives explicitly.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Repeat: simulate another ~20K races with the updated {'\u03BB'} values, compute loss, take another step.
            Each evaluation uses a different random seed to smooth the stochastic loss surface.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After ~100-200 iterations (2-4 million simulated races total), the optimizer converges.
          The fit loss reported in the dashboard footer tells you how well the final {'\u03BB'} values
          reproduce the market odds — lower is better.

        <details className="deep-dive">
          <summary>Deep dive: Why Plackett-Luce?</summary>
          <div className="deep-dive-content">
            <h4>The core problem</h4>
            <p>
              After devigging, we have marginal probabilities: P(Russell wins) = 14.5%,
              P(Russell finishes top 3) = 39.5%, and so on. But fantasy points depend on the
              exact finishing position, not just "top N" cutoffs. We need the full joint
              distribution: what's the probability Russell finishes exactly P4? P7? P15?
            </p>
            <p>
              You can't just interpolate between the marginals. Finishing positions are
              dependent — if Russell finishes P1, Antonelli can't also finish P1. We need
              a model that respects this structure.
            </p>

            <h4>Plackett-Luce</h4>
            <p>
              The Plackett-Luce model (Luce, 1959; Plackett, 1975) is a sequential choice
              model for rankings. Each item (driver) has a strength {'\u03BB'}_i {'\u003E'} 0.
              A ranking is generated by repeatedly choosing from the remaining set:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>P(driver i wins) = {'\u03BB'}_i / ({'\u03BB'}_1 + {'\u03BB'}_2 + ... + {'\u03BB'}_22)</li>
              <li>P(driver j finishes 2nd | driver i won) = {'\u03BB'}_j / (sum of remaining {'\u03BB'}s)</li>
              <li>And so on, until all positions are filled</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This gives us a complete probability distribution over all 22! possible finishing
              orders, parameterized by just 22 numbers. From this, we can compute any marginal
              we want: P(finish exactly P4), P(finish top 6), P(beat a specific rival), etc.
            </p>

            <h4>Team structure</h4>
            <p>
              We decompose each driver's log-strength as {'\u03BC'}_team + {'\u03B4'}_driver, where
              teammates share the team component. This means if the optimizer determines that
              Mercedes has a strong car this weekend, both Russell and Antonelli benefit. The
              driver-specific {'\u03B4'} captures within-team differences. Regularization penalizes
              large teammate gaps, reflecting the reality that most performance difference is
              the car, not the driver.
            </p>

            <h4>Alternatives considered</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Bradley-Terry model</strong> — works well for pairwise comparisons
              (who beats whom?) but doesn't naturally extend to full rankings of 22 items.
              You'd need to compute each finishing position by conditioning on all possible
              higher-position outcomes, which is computationally expensive and doesn't leverage
              the sequential structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Thurstone model</strong> — assigns each driver a latent utility drawn
              from a normal distribution (driver i gets utility U_i ~ N({'\u03BC'}_i, {'\u03C3'}^2)).
              Rankings are determined by sorting utilities. This is similar to PL in practice
              but uses normal distributions instead of Gumbel (extreme value) distributions.
              The key downside: the normal distribution produces thinner tails, making upsets
              less likely than they actually are in F1. The PL/Gumbel setup better captures
              the occasional chaotic race.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Copula approaches</strong> — model the dependence structure between
              finishing positions directly. Extremely flexible but massively overparameterized
              for our data. With only 4-5 market constraints per driver (win, podium, top 6,
              top 10, DNF), we can't identify all the correlation parameters. PL gives us
              a reasonable dependence structure (via the sequential elimination mechanism)
              from just one parameter per driver.

              {'\u03A3'}_{'{'}j{'\u2260'}i{'}'} [P(j wins) {'\u00D7'} P(i wins from remaining)].
              For P(finishes 3rd), you need to sum over all possible (winner, runner-up) pairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time you get to P(finishes P11), you're summing over all possible
              orderings of the top 10 — that's 10! = 3.6 million terms. For P(finishes P22),
              you'd need 21! terms. This is computationally intractable for 22 drivers.

            <h4>What simulation gives us</h4>
            <p>
              Monte Carlo simulation sidesteps this entirely. We just draw many random
              races and count how often each outcome occurs. With 50K simulations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The full probability distribution (P1 through P22 + DNF) for every driver</li>
              <li>Standard deviations and confidence intervals for free</li>
              <li>Any derived quantity: expected points, P(beat rival), P(score {'\u2265'} 10 pts), etc.</li>
              <li>Standard error of ~0.2 percentage points for the most common outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The 50K simulation count is a balance between precision and compute time. For
              the model fitting (which runs inside the optimizer loop), we use ~20K sims per
              evaluation to keep it fast while still being smooth enough for gradient-based
              optimization.

      <section className="meth-section">
        <div className="step-num">4</div>
        <h2>Compute Expected Points</h2>
        <p>
          Expected points = {'\u03A3'} P(position k) {'\u00D7'} points(k) + P(DNF) {'\u00D7'} (-20). Each finishing
          position contributes its probability times its point value. The DNF penalty of -20 is
          a significant drag — drivers with high DNF risk (12%+) can have negative expected points
          even if they occasionally finish in the top 10.
        </p>

        <details className="deep-dive">
          <summary>Deep dive: Why this scoring changes optimal picks</summary>
          <div className="deep-dive-content">
            <h4>The DNF penalty dominates strategy</h4>
            <p>
              In our scoring system, a DNF costs -20 points. That's equivalent to losing a
              P2 finish plus a P8 finish. If a driver has a 10% DNF chance, that's an expected
              cost of -2.0 points per race — which is substantial when the median expected
              points for a midfield driver might be 3-4 points.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means reliability is far more important in our league than in the official
              F1 Fantasy game (which doesn't penalize DNFs as heavily). A consistent P6-P8
              finisher with low DNF risk can easily outscore a flashier driver who occasionally
              wins but retires more often.
            </p>

            <h4>Variance matters for picks</h4>
            <p>
              Since you pick 5 drivers, diversification matters. Two teammates are positively
              correlated (they share the same car), so picking both Mercedes drivers gives you
              less diversification than picking one Mercedes and one Ferrari. The standard
              deviation column on the dashboard helps identify high-variance picks — useful
              when you're behind in the standings and need upside.

          Adjust a driver's strength parameter and see how it changes their position

          show the result with your adjustment. Watch how the model probabilities diverge from
          the market constraints as you move further from the fitted value — that's the fit
